Tags
====
These tags help you write liquid templates. There are standard ones over @ https://github.com/Shopify/liquid/wiki/Liquid-for-Designers but this document only covers the MMS-specific ones.

Resize Image Tag
----------------
Given an image hash uploaded using the public images uploader, will automatically resize and compress that image and cache it for later use. Returns a relative URL to the resized image. You can call this with multiple sizes. Each time it's encountered, the image will be resized if required. If already resized, it simply returns the URL.

Example use:
{{ 'd41d8cd98f00b204e9800998ecf8427e' | resize_img: 'jpg',200,100 }}

Outputs:
"/resized_images_cache/d41/d8c/d98f00b204e9800998ecf8427e-200.jpg"

The "resized_images_cache" path may vary, depending on your installation configuration (see config/initializers/resized_images_cache_path.rb). The first 2 sub-folders are the first 6 digits of the hash provided.

The 'jpg' is the file extension for this image.

The first number, 200, is the desired width. The second is the desired height.

If you want to wrap this into an image tag (<img>), you must do so yourself in the liquid template.


URL Escape
----------
Escapes a string.

url_escape: Converts any non-URL characters into their percent equivalents: e.g. space => %20
